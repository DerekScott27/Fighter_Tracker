# Fighter Tracker

A simple app for tracking fighters, fights, and basic stats. I put this together to keep a tidy list of fighters I follow — add and view fighters and their specific skillset for analysis / study. Built to be small and useful, not fancy but there is more to come!

Live demo: https://fighter-tracker.vercel.app/  
Repo: https://github.com/DerekScott27/Fighter_Tracker

What it does
- Sign in and manage a personal list of fighters
- Add, edit, and remove fighter records
- Search and filter fighters
- Basic stats/summary views

Quick start (run locally)
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DerekScott27/Fighter_Tracker.git
cd Fighter_Tracker
